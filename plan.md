## Plan for Iteration 2
To ensure that iteration 2 is completed evenly over the allocated period of time to a desirable quality before the deadline, we've agreed on the following action plan as a scaffold to work from:

The table below indicates the 'logical buckets' or 'modules', we've split the functions required into. These were grouped based on the nature of the task. They have been accorded  accordingly in order of ideal implementation as to minimise time spent waiting for others to finish their work. Exceptions have been highlighted, where some parts need to be completed first or later. Each module has been assigned to a sub-group of pairs and also assigned an estimated time required for completion. 

|           |Module and Functions                                   |Assignees & ETC |
|-|-|-|
|**Week 4**    |**Authentication** (auth_login, auth_logout, auth_register, auth_passwordreset_request, auth_passwordreset_reset) | TL + BC (~5hrs) **__PRIORITY__** |
|           |**Channel Manipulation** (channel_invite, channel_details, **channel_messages***, channel_leave, channel_join, channel_addowner, channel_removeowner) | EM + YP + XC (~9hrs)|
|           |**Standup Review** (Progress review, code review and sync) | ALL (~2hrs @ Sat)|
|**Week 5**     |**Channel Listing** (channels_list, channels_listall, channels_create) | EM (~3hrs)  **__PRIORITY__**|
|           |**Messages Primary** (message_sendlater, message_send, message_remove, message_edit) + **channel_messages*** | TL + BC (~6hrs)|
|           |**Messages Secondary** (message_react, message_unreact, message_pin, message_unpin)| YP + XC (~4hrs) |
|           |**Standup Review** (Progress review, code review and sync) | ALL (~2hrs @ Sat)|
|**Week 6**     |**User Profile** (user_profile, user_profile_setname, user_profile_setemail, user_profile_sethandle, user_profiles_uploadphoto) | EM + YP + XC (~7hrs)|
|           |**Misc.** (standup_start, standup_send, search, admin_userpermission_change) | TL + BC (~6hrs)|
|           |**Final Testing** (Testing own and each other's work) | ALL (~2hrs)
|           |**Final Review** (Progress review, code review, testing and submission) |ALL (~**4**hrs @ Sat)|


On top of each team's module and functions, we've scheduled weekly online standup reviews on Saturdays, which had the best availability. This was in conjunction with meeting during the tutorials and labs in person to work on iterations. This included a session for final testing in the final week in addition to regular testing on the go. A final review was also included to join all the work and finalise till everybody is satisfied to submit. 

Weekly standups were created so that the project was completed in an AGILE development approach, meaning that at each weekly standup session, we expected to have working functions that could be used to some extent. If changes were required, this would be implemented in conjunction with the new functions in the following week ready for the next standup.

Our plan involves the utilisation of GitLab as a software collaboration tool heavily. All members should create their own branches and not merge to master until agreed to by the whole group. Members should create their own merge requests and others should check and vote accordingly. All members should pull and push to Git and comment clearly. When work was done, members should update the Issues board accordingly, as to reflect the progress of the iteration. Known issues or bugs should also be raised into Git, so that others could see these issues and work accordingly. In addition to Git, we also use Facebook Messenger to chat with each other online and organise our weekly meetings.
